# Roomlight -- hotel room lighting solved once and for all!
### A hotel room light controller -- design the lighting once, sync it to every room.

Eemeli Group is pleased to announce that the evolution of hotel room lighting has reached a new stage.

Want to find that piece of see through plastic you dropped? Let there be light.
Want to sink into a romantic evening gloom? But honey, it's 7 AM. No problem, let me turn down the sun for you.
No need to tell her that it's a Roomlight preset mood configuration.

_"Hotels should be about relaxation and wonder, but their light design is basic and boring._
_Roomlight helps set the stage for a perfect holiday."_
_- Eemeli, CEO and founder of Eemeli Group_

Roomlight is an integrated system controlling the smart lights in all of the rooms in your hotel.
Light configurations can be applied from the hotels overview system, or inside the rooms.
Our engineers will guide you through the process of setting up the system the day you make the call.

_"I didn't even know that lighting made such a difference in my mental state."_
